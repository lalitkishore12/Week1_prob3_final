Problem 3 of week 1

The derivation and draft model drawing pdf is put int he folder named 'Derivation'.

The range is 100Hz to 1000 Hz for this Highpass filter to function properly.

111Hz = 700 rad/sec 120Hz = 750 rad/sec 127Hz = 800 rad/sec 135Hz = 850 rad/sec 143Hz = 900 rad/sec

In the above data, decimal points have been rounded off.

For the problem, above 5 frequencies are used for calculation. Pertaining screenshots are place in the 'Screenshots' folder.

Derviation is written in the 'problem 3.pdf' file
